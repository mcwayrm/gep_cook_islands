## Trip to the Cook Islands {.smaller}

::: {.nonincremental} 
- Thanks to Justin and Steve, I was given the opportunity to visit the Cook Islands.
- This was a follow up workshop related to the People, Planet, Prosperity (3P) Project.
- I attended the Cook Islands [3P project](https://naturalcapitalproject.stanford.edu/research/projects/mainstreaming-nature-decisions) follow up meeting. 
- The Cook Islands are one of 10 countries in this project.
- The Cook Islands' Project was a collaboration with ADB, Cook Island NES, and Cook Islands MFEM.

## 3Ps: Cook Islands {.smaller}

::: {.nonincremental} 
- A major issue for the Cook Islands is coastal flooding and wasterwater pollution. 
- Specifically in a popular tourist destination -- Muri Lagoon on the main island of Rarotonga. 
- Over the past year, NatCap Stanford piloted a case study project creating natural capital assessments to assist local members in evaluating options related to potential urban and water projects

## My Goal for the Trip  {.smaller}

::: {.nonincremental} 
- In the first meeting (2024), GEP was mentioned. 
- The attendees were excited to learn more about this measure. 
- So I attended the follow up meeting to introduce the concept (Jan. 2025)
- My attendance aimed to: 
1. Educate about GEP
2. Gauge interest in estimating GEP
3. Assessing capacity to estimate GEP for Cook Islands

## Muri Lagoon Natural Capital Assessment  {.smaller}

::: {.nonincremental} 

- Muri Lagoon is a major source of economic activity for the country. 
- But poor coastal management with high tourism is degrading their sacred atolls
- The NatCap team used InVEST to evaluate counterfactual solutions to improve:
  - Water treatment (pollution)
  - Coastal erosion (flooding)
  - Nutrient runoff
- To determine financing of these options, NatCap performed a choice experiment to measure Willingness-to-Pay
  - E.g., price for solutions
  - Surveyed 420 people: 324 residents, 96 tourists

## GEP for Cook Island Trip {.smaller}

::: {.nonincremental} 
- At the workshop, I presented an introduction to GEP. 
- There was some interest in the room, but interest dissipated after the workshop. 
- We met with Minstry of Financial and Economic Management (MFEM) and National Environmental Service (NES).
- Notably, no one from Statistics attended any meetings.

## GEP for Cook Island Trip {.smaller}

::: {.nonincremental} 
> For the Cook Islands, we hit a road block. 

- On the Islands, they do not have funding or capacity to support this project. 
- They are interested if someone else can estimate GEP, but not themselves. 
- Estimating GEP independetly would be difficult. 
  - Data is siloed in departments with no data hub 
  - Data is often ad hoc and out of date
- Follow up meetings with NatCap Stanford did not lead to a continuation of the project.

## Potential Path Forward {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
- Working with Jade Delevaux (NatCap Stanford)
- Build guide for practioners to use GEP in practice.
- Benefits: 
  - Generates public GEP data sets 
  - Useful for input to research and assessing environmental progress
- Jade would like a use case to be Belize 
  - 10 year partnership, centralized data hub

  - Nature's contribution 
  - Price
  - Quantity
- Discuss equations, data requirements, and limitations
- Recommendations for reporting standards 
  - SNA and SEEA EA

## Hopeful Product has Competition {.smaller}

::: {.nonincremental} 
> The aim is to produce some living document (website) with best practices. 

- There already appears to be a market for this (competition). 
  - Two papers in [Ambio](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-023-01948-8) and [J of Resources and Ecology](https://www.jorae.cn/EN/10.5814/j.issn.1674-764x.2022.03.014) spelling out recommendations
  - JRC Techincal reports on [application](https://edepot.wur.nl/654191) and [theory](file:///C:/Users/ryanm/Downloads/JRC138106_01.pdf)
  - [Guidelines](https://seea.un.org/sites/seea.un.org/files/1._gross_ecosystem_product_and_ecological_assets_0.pdf) by SEEA EA for integration of GEP.
  - Ljing has mentioned a Chinese textbook on GEP: "Theory and Method of Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) Accounting" (English translation next year)
